# Java Notes
My notes from reading the book Java Cookbook by Ian F. Darwin and my some of my own notes.

## Compiling, Running, and Debugging

### Avoiding the need for debuggers with Unit Testing
* To avoid constantly debugging your code, use unit testing to validate each class as you develop it.
* Typically, in an OO language like Java, unit testing is applied to individual classes, in contrast to "system" or "integration" testing where the entire application is tested.
* Developers of the software methodology known as Extreme Programming (XP for short) advocate "Test Driven Development"(TDD): writing the unit tests before you write the code. They also advocate running your tests almost every time you build your application.

### Maintaining your code with Continuous Integration
* To be sure that your entire code base compiles and passes its tests periodically, use a Continuous Integration server such as Jenkins/Hudson.
* CI is simply the practice of having all developers on a project periodically integrate their changes into a single master copy of the project's "source". This might be a few times a day, or every few days, but should not be more than that, else the integration will likely run into larger hurdles where multiple developers have modified the same file.
* And it's not just code-based projects that benefit from CI. If you have a number of small websites, putting them all under CI control is one of the several important steps toward developing an automated, "dev-ops" culture around website deployment and management.

## Strings and Things
* Strings in Java are immutable. If you need to change characters within a String, you should instead create a StringBuilder (possibly initialized to the starting value of the String), manipulate the StringBuilder to your heart's content and then convert that to String at the end, using the ubiquitous toString() method.
  * It may be possible to tinker with the String's internal data structures using the Reflection API. Secured environments, of course, do not permit access to the Reflection API.
  
### Breaking strings into words
* To accomplish this, construct a StringTokenizer around your and call its methods hasMoreTokens() and nextToken().
* Or use regular expressions. ====> see /javanotes/StringNotes
* Many occurrences of StringTokenizer may be replaced with regular expressions with considerably more flexibility.

### Putting strings together with StringBuilder
* Use string concatenation: the + operator. The compiler implicitly constructs a StringBuilder for you and uses its append() methods. You can also construct a
StringBuilder yourself.
* StringBuilder and StringBuffer are identical, except for the fact that StringBuilder is not threadsafe

### Processing a String one character at a time
* Use a for loop and the String's charAt() method. Or a "for each" loop and the String's toCharArray method.

## Reverse a String by Word or by Character
* You can reverse a string by character easily, using a StringBuilder and calling the reverse(). ==> look at /javanotes/StringNotes

## Regex Processing
* regex - is a string of characters that describes a character sequence. This general description called a pattern can then be used to find matches in other character sequences. 
* Use the **Pattern** class to define a regular expression.
* Match the pattern against another sequence using **Matcher**.
* The simplest pattern matching method is **matches()**. For there to be a match, the entire character sequence must match the pattern, not just a subsequence of it. If it matches, matches() returns true, otherwise false.
* To determine if a subsequence of the input sequence matches the pattern, use **find()**. It returns true if there is a matching subsequence and false otherwise. This method can be called repeatedly allowing it to find all matching subsequences. Each call to find() begins where the previous one left off. 
* You can obtain a string containing the last matching sequence by calling **group()**.
* If no matching exists, then an **IllegalStateException** is thrown.
* You can replace all occurrences of a matching sequence with another sequence by calling **replaceAll()**.
* example, parsing the file name to get the extension
* <pre>Pattern pat = Pattern.compile("(\\.[^.]+)$");
  Matcher mat = pat.matcher("today.jpeg");
  // To get the extension first call find then group
  if(mat.find()) // if it finds an extension
    System.out.println(mat.group())
  else
    System.out.println("NO MATCH");
  </pre>
